# MapReduce Data Processing with MRJob

Welcome to the **MapReduce Data Processing with MRJob** repository! This project showcases a series of data processing tasks using **MRJob**, a Python library designed for **MapReduce** operations. Each task demonstrates the efficiency of distributed computing for handling large-scale data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository includes implementations of various **MapReduce** problems, covering text analysis, frequency calculations, social media analytics, and data aggregation.

## 🚀 Implemented Tasks
1. **Word Count** – Counting words while excluding specific stop words  
2. **Character Frequency** – Calculating frequency of each character in a text file  
3. **Longest Word Finder** – Identifying the longest words in a dataset  
4. **Tweet Count** – Counting the number of tweets per user  
5. **Average Word Length** – Computing the mean length of words in a document  
6. **Hashtag Frequency** – Analyzing hashtag occurrences in social media posts  
7. **Most Frequent Words** – Finding the most common words in a document  
8. **Product Sales Aggregation** – Summing total product sales based on dataset  
9. **City Temperature Analysis** – Calculating the average temperature per city  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
