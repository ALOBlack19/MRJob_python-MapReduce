# MapReduce Data Processing with MRJob
Welcome to the MapReduce Data Processing with MRJob repository! This project showcases a series of data processing tasks using MRJob, a Python library designed for MapReduce operations. Each task demonstrates the efficiency of distributed computing for handling large-scale data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository includes implementations of various MapReduce problems, covering text analysis, frequency calculations, social media analytics, and data aggregation.

## 🚀 Implemented Tasks
Each problem is solved using MapReduce to optimize data processing:

Word Count – Counting words while excluding specific stop words

Character Frequency – Calculating frequency of each character in a text file

Longest Word Finder – Identifying the longest words in a dataset

Tweet Count – Counting the number of tweets per user

Average Word Length – Computing the mean length of words in a document

Hashtag Frequency – Analyzing hashtag occurrences in social media posts

Most Frequent Words – Finding the most common words in a document

Product Sales Aggregation – Summing total product sales based on dataset

City Temperature Analysis – Calculating the average temperature per city

## 📂 Files & Structure
Each task includes:

Python scripts implementing MRJob-based MapReduce solutions

Input text files containing sample data for processing

Output files with processed results

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
